Currently finishing my studies in computer graphics at ESIR school, I'm doing an internship as a Graphics research intern at Unity Technologies.
  
I'm particularly interested in light transport simulation and image synthesis tools but I also worked on image processing and computer vision projects.

The purpose of this page is to list and present some of the projects I have done.

The main project I made is a path tracing renderer in C++ and CUDA. I started this project during an image synthesis project consisting on a raycasting renderer. At the end of the project, I continue working an this render to add some new features including global illumination with path tracing, different kind of materials or area lights. It was for me the most interesting project and I'm still working on it during my free time.

I also worked on a dynamic blur for video games based on saillance models. We proposed an implementation of differents simple saillance models for unity games. We had the chance to show our work to Kenneth Vanhoey a research scientist at Unity Technologies.

My last project was a multi-frame super resolution application in Android. I worked and this subject during my internship in research and development team of Jouve. I was a really interested project where the main limitations where really different from my usual C++ development projects.
