During 4 months of internship at Jouve, I worked on an Android super resolution prototype. This project followed my internship tutor’s work on a super resolution prototype for iOS. 
Our super resolution model is based on multi-frame merging in order to reduce the missing information in the single capture.

I have built an application capturing a burst of images and merging them to create a super resolution image. With super resolution images we can reveal small details that are invisible in single frames.
The image below show a single frame and a super resolution image created by our application.

It was a really interesting project and a great experience for me. I learn a lot about super resolution, research and development and Android development.
